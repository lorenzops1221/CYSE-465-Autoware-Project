# CYSE-465-Autoware-Project
Below are my contributions to the CYSE 465 Autoware project: 

Autoware.ai with Rviz:
* I gained understanding of Autoware and the perception stack of LGSVL: https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware-Manuals/blob/master/en/Autoware_UsersManual_v1.1.md
* Ran Autoware.AI 1.14.0 with SVL Simulator and Rviz (as this contributed to orignal plan to test attack on autopilot features). Commands are documented in the following link: https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/system-under-test/autoware-instructions/

SVL with Rviz:
* Launch Autware.ai in conjunction with SVL Simulator: ./run.sh -t 1.1.4.0 and roslaunch runtime_manager runtime_manager.launch , then load each respective .launch file in Runtime Manager as stated in tutorial. For our simulation, Jack created a map on Cubetown with our adversarial object, and Kevin converted this map to cooperate with Runtime Manager as a .launch file, so This would be the only difference in loaded files. 
* I actively joined group meetings even if only viewing the VM session and offering suggestions on troubleshooting for controller: 
* Specifically, troubleshooting included attempts in fixing faulty localization via "2D Pose Estimate" which prevented Autoware.AI with Rviz to run with Mission Planning launch. Using GNSS for localization and commenting ndt_matching in my_localization.launch file did not fix issues, however. Relaunching Mission Planning and attempting new "2D Nav Goals" would either result in failed localization, or very short successful localization before failing and the vehicle failing to complete the route. Other members confirmed most faults at this time were due to CPU issues. 
* CPU Issues shown below (Kevin kept in contact with GMU ORC to continuously add CPU Cores until we had 10 more added, but CPU issues persisted despite some performance increase)

* Additional troubleshooting included marking "detection" in runtime manager, as this was not stated in instructions, but performed in an instructional video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cASgrZpFlEU

* LGSVL could not load map and I researched our given error. Found no similar error other than the following unresolved ticket: https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues/2012 - This issue was resolved by Jack after rebooting

SVL with Apollo 5.0:

* Group eventually switched from Rviz to Apollo 5.0 after continuous issues with Rviz. Learned to run Apollo with SVL Simulator using docker/scripts/dev_into.sh, bootsraph.sh, bridge.sh: https://www.svlsimulator.com/docs/system-under-test/apollo5-0-instructions/

* Explored additional resources to get autonomous driving working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=781zkzN2xMg (Does not utilize perception stack), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwJi1xrpj7E (Method did not work with SVL Simulator)
* Simulation set up by Jack and run by Kevin showing LiDAR not picking up cone

* Was active in group discord/discussions as shown below:

Additional Contributions:
* For the Autoware project writeup, I wrote the threat model portion
* For the video demonstration, I presented the threat model portion
* Threat Model details were gathered from information in the following source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03778.pdf
